# template_engine
Template engine is a simple project given me in Introduction to Programming course in Sofia University.
In the PDF file you can find the whole task combined with examples.

#Running the project
    1.Create two files (.txt):
        One containing the template data in jinja2 sintax and another containing the data 
        which later will be written in the output file
    2. Run the project and in the console window write the path to the both files.
    3. Then in the media/ folder will be created the desired files (.txt format)
